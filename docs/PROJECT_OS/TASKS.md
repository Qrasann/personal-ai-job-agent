# Tasks

## v3.5.2
- [x] Search preference engine.
- [x] Source enable/disable.
- [x] Source priority.
- [x] Multi-country selection and priorities.
- [x] Multi-city scope.
- [x] Relocation/visa/work-permit/package/immigration policies.
- [x] Button-driven Telegram Control Center.
- [x] Integrate prefilter/order into scan pipeline.
- [x] Unit tests for preference engine.
- [x] Add career-first, relocation-first and balanced search strategies.
- [x] Keep career and relocation discovery queries independent.
- [x] Add Telegram strategy selection and `/relocationroles`.
- [x] Add unauthenticated Arbeitnow Germany discovery with conservative support signals.
- [x] Add further public international sources with explicit candidate-eligibility evidence.
- [x] Add public Job Bank Canada discovery for international candidates; keep
  LMIA, eligibility and explicit support evidence separate.
- [x] Add public EURES vacancies explicitly flagged for cross-border
  recruitment; keep this separate from visa and relocation support.
- [x] Add opt-in independent Career-first and Relocation-first SearchProfiles.
- [x] Make one scan discover and match each active SearchProfile independently.
- [x] Preserve profile settings and matches when parallel search is disabled.
- [x] Full CI green (GitHub Actions run 110 succeeded for v3.5.4; Fast Scan
  code run 105 also passed).
- [x] Add current/desired/minimum salary controls in Telegram; minimum feeds
  the existing per-currency scoring threshold.
- [x] Add Telegram blacklist controls with case-insensitive add/remove/clear,
  persisted across active search directions.
- [x] Compare testsbuild with main and selectively port useful behavior;
  Saved navigation already exists locally, and no broad branch merge was needed.
- [ ] Complete comprehensive Telegram acceptance in a real chat; local polling,
  dual-profile scheduled scan, and updated startup scan passed.
- [ ] Tag v3.5.2 after acceptance.

## Next
## v3.5.4 Multi-Source International Discovery
- [x] Add bounded EURES discovery for the employer's cross-border recruitment
  flag and support EURES destination-country selection.
- [x] Full PostgreSQL suite (203 passed) and coverage gate (64.39%) pass;
  GitHub Actions run 110 passes; Compose runtime updated to 3.5.4.
- [ ] Complete real-chat acceptance for the latest Telegram controls and
  source dashboard before tagging releases.

## v3.5.3 Fast Scan & Scan Dashboard
- [x] Run independent source discovery with a bounded concurrency of three;
  preserve source priority for sequential matching/ingestion.
- [x] Add source duration and isolated timeout/error reporting.
- [x] Reuse existing discovery cache; persist latest manual scan status and
  source summary in `runtime_state`.
- [x] Add `/scanstatus` and `/cancel` for in-flight manual scans.
- [x] Validate rebuilt Telegram bot polling and startup scan; real-chat command
  controls remain part of v3.5.2 acceptance above.
- [ ] Consider competition/applicant signals where public sources expose them.
